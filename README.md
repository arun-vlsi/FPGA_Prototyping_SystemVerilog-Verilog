# FPGA_Prototyping_SystemVerilog-Verilog
This repository contains Verilog and SystemVerilog example designs based on the book  
**"FPGA Prototyping by SystemVerilog Examples" by Pong P. Chu**.

The examples are intended for learning FPGA prototyping, RTL design,
and understanding basic to intermediate digital design concepts.
